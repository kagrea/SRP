If a warrior from the town could best him in single combat, his gang of bandits would leave peacefully. Even though the young human had only joined the town guard one season ago, he could already best every other guard with the sword. To the surprise of the townsfolk, he drew his sword, muttered a prayer, and stepped forward to defend his home.",

Along with three of her best soldiers, she had made her way to the enemy general's tent with the intent to rout the army or die in the attempt. In a fully pitched battle, the small band of dwarves under her command wouldn't stand a chance against this great host. However, if her group of elite soldiers followed her orders to the letter, they had a chance to cut off the head of the army before it came to battle. For what could be her final mission, she gripped her battleaxe and gave the order to move out.",
