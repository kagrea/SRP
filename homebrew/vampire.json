				"A clan well-known for being the most beautiful, sensual, seductive, emotional and glamorous of vampire-kind. They utilize Auspex—a discipline revolving around enhancing one’s vampiric supernatural senses. It is complex as it is entrancing, and many practitioners go on to become world-renowned telepaths and mystics. It is not hard to see why the emphasis exists either—for a clan focused whose art often involves the use of their eyes, hands, and mouths, it’s clear to see why Auspex would be so appealing.",
				"Beyond their skill in Auspex, the Toreador are both famous and infamous as a clan of artists and innovators, they are the bastion of the vampiric art world. Their very survival depends on the facades of civility and grace on which the sect prides itself—a reason, one might postulate, to explain their strong force of will, and uncanny instinct. A typical member of the Toreador clan is said to become so enamored by art and beauty that it takes such a high force of will (and a companion to pull them away) to avoid being drawn into its artistic splendor for hours on end.",
				"In addition, as those who respect elegance and beauty, the Toreador are more concerned in romantic endeavors than other vampires—often settling down with a suitable partner for reasons other than political marriage. The vice that the Toreador chose to experience was romance, a surprising and inherently human emotion. It is for this reason that the Toreador are seen as some of the more “humane” vampires, but that isn’t to say their beastial nature cannot sometimes be horrifying. It is not too difficult to imagine a Toreador, so enamored by the messages they find within artistry, slaughtering innocents for the sake of some grander artistic endeavor.",
				"In short, it could be safer to say that excess, in any amount, is not a good thing—that is why the Toreador have ideologically split themselves into two divisions: the Artists (comprising sculptors, painters, musicians, and writers), and the Poseurs (comprising failed artists such as those Embraced while their sire was riding a particular fad). It should be noted that neither group has a leader or organization behind them—they are merely brandings that tend to be flung at fellow Toreador clan members as a sort of derogatory epithet.",

Whenever you manifest your bone talons, you can also choose to manifest bone-like quills from the pores on your skin. These quills can only emerge if you are unarmored, or if you are wearing light or medium armor—not even your bones emerge with enough force to pierce metal. If your bone talons are already out, bringing out your quills is still a bonus action.",
				"While your bone-like quills are present and ready to inflict fear, your AC becomes equal to 12 + your Constitution modifier. In addition, whenever a creature successfully hits you with a melee attack, starts their turn grappling you, or is currently grappled by you, that creature takes magical piercing damage equal to your proficiency bonus. A creature can only take this damage once per turn.",
				"This armor lasts for one minute, and retracts automatically at the conclusion of said minute. You can bring out your armor of quills a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses on a long rest. Starting at 11th level, you instead regain all expended uses on a short or long rest."
