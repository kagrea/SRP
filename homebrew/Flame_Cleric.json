But at the same time, it is warm, comforting, and gives life to those who rest within its guiding heat. Gods who wield each end of the spectrum and everywhere between are a dime a dozen. Look to Angi, Odqan, Zhurong, Grannus, Hestia, or Logi to understand the breadth of their differences and the many forms the flame can take.",
