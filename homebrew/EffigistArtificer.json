				"You learn how to create magical effigies. Using any set of artisan’s tools of your choice, you can take an action to  magically create a Tiny figurine in your hands. This figurine can be held in one hand, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus. When you create the effigy, you determine its appearance. It may be a jade figurine, a sackcloth doll, a clay mock-up, or even spoons in a pickle jar.",
				"Once you create a magical effigy, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. You can only have one magical effigy at a time. If you create a new one, the original one loses its magic. The effigy also loses its magic after 1 hour, and you can dismiss its magic early as an action.",
				"When you create an effigy you designate a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear for it to represent. This connection remains even if the creature moves out of range. As an action on each of your turns, you can designate for the effigy to represent a new qualifying creature. This connection ends when the effigy loses its magic.",
				"You can target the represented creature with spells that have a range of Touch, by casting such a spell on the effigy. The effigy counts as a creature that you can see for the purposes of what you can target with such a spell.",
				"As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can expose the effigy to a harmful effect within 5 feet of you to potentially damage the represented creature. The harmful effect must deal bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage. When you harm the effigy, the represented creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or else take {@dice 2d8} of the corresponding damage type.",
				"If you use your action to cast a spell that deals a qualifying type of damage, you can choose for the effigy connection to deal that type of damage. For example, if you use your action to cast {@spell frostbite|xge}, you can choose for the effigy connection to deal cold damage, regardless of whether you exposed the effigy to the actual spell effects or not."
