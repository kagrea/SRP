When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.",

Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge?

Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty.

				"When you channel your divine energy through your weapon, the power doesn't merely flow; it bursts in a torrent of arcane unpredictability. As you unleash a smite upon your foes, the very weave of magic shudders and twists, producing effects as awe-inspiring as they are varied. When you smite, you roll on the Smite Effects table that corresponds to the spell slot you are expending. Should your smite be a critical hit, the universe conspires to unleash dual manifestations of wild magic—roll twice on the table and apply both results. You unlock the Level 1 Smite Effects table when you reach 3 levels in Paladin, and subsequent tables at levels 5, 9, 13, and 17."

For the next minute, or until you next smite, you take on the terrifying and mighty image of a warrior-tree-person. You gain 10 temporary hit points, you make Constitution saving throws with advantage, you make Dexterity- and Wisdom-based attack rolls with advantage, and while you are on the ground, the ground within 15 feet of you is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for your enemies.

Any levels of {@condition exhaustion|PHB} end when this effect does. Roll a {@dice d8}. On a 1, the cube is centered on you."],
						["16.", "Divine bitch smack. You flourish, and catch the target of your smite with the most humiliating strike possible and stagger them in disbelief. The attack does {@dice 4d6} psychic damage to your foe, leaving them to ponder their life decisions. They must make a wisdom saving throw, on a failure they have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can’t take reactions until the end of it’s next turn. Roll a {@dice d8}. On a 1, you were a little too cocky with your move and karma is a bitch. You look down and realize you’ve stood in poo. You become too busy cleaning off your footwear to take reactions and you make all charisma checks and saves with disadvantage until the end of your next turn."],
						["17.", "Your weapon glistens with a new, unsettling sheen—a thick, pulsating layer of otherworldly, living, slime. With each strike, the corrosive ooze splashes onto your enemy, sizzling upon contact as it weakens armor. For the next minute, or until you smite again, each time you make a successful attack with the weapon used for this smite, the slime corrodes the armor of your foe, reducing its AC by 1. Roll a {@dice d8}. On a 1 you must make a Dexterity saving throw each time this happens to avoid the splash and have your armor reduced as well. Armor damaged in this way can be repaired over the course of a short rest with an appropriate tools or skill check, or by using magical repair."],

The choice of new positions may fall into hands both favorable and unfavorable. Everybody within 45 ft of you swaps places. Roll a {@dice d8}.

Time holds its breath as you pull the lever. The celestial cogs turn, deciding whether you'll reap untold rewards or face dire consequences. Roll {@dice 3d6}. If all three results are the same number, you, and anyone you designate in your aura, gain the benefits of a long rest.

Your very presence seems to lure magical energy towards you, and this energy spills over to those near you.

For the next minute, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, and are immune to cold, fire, and poison.

They must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or vanish, being thrown to another point in time and causing the attack to miss or the spell to be wasted.
