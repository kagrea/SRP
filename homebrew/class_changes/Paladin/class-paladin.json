Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.",

Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge?

Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.",

As you unleash a smite upon your foes, the very weave of magic shudders and twists, producing effects as awe-inspiring as they are varied. When you smite, you roll on the Smite Effects table that corresponds to the spell slot you are expending. Should your smite be a critical hit, the universe conspires to unleash dual manifestations of wild magic—roll twice on the table and apply both results. You unlock the Level 1 Smite Effects table when you reach 3 levels in Paladin, and subsequent tables at levels 5, 9, 13, and 17."
