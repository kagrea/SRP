Before him laid an automaton of intricate iron gears within a suit of plate armor, built to resemble a large gnome. As the tiny inventor affixed his signature mithril mustache to the face plate, a jolt of electric-blue magic flashed from the automaton. With a sharp motion, the Steel Defender sat upright and awaited the first command of its creator.",

This was the third time this year his clan had moved burrows to avoid being raided by adventuring parties, and the inventive goblin was determined to protect the newest home burrow. He was confident that this time he would stop the adventurers that always seemed to find their way to his home.",
